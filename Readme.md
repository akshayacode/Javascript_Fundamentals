#How Javascript Works and Exceution Context

Everything in Javascript happens inside "Execution Context"

#Execution context

It is has two components

1.Memory component (Variable Environment)

Stored as Key value pairs

2.Code (Thread of Execution)

code is executed one line at a time 

#Javascript is a synchronous single threaded Language

single threaded --> one line at a time
synchronous --> follows some order (it will move to next line only after the execution current line )
